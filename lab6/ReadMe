To run the compiler:
1- Run 'make'
2- Run './comp.c < input_file', note: 'input_file' is the source code to be compiled
3- After that, 2 file will be generated:
    *file_1: 'regs_alloc.interm' which is the UnSSA intermediate representation (IR).
    *file_2: 'prog.s' which is the the assimbly code.
4- To compile 'prog.s', run the command below:
   gcc prog.s
5- Lastly, execute it as the following: ./a.out

NOTE: 
- 'x86_aux_stuff.file' must be exist in the same directory where 'comp' is exist.
- In 'makefile' file we used flag '-std=c99' to make it work on linprog.
- We added 'get_bool' function to 'x86_aux_stuff.file' in addition to those ones that Prof. Fedyukovic has provided.
